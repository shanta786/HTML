			<p style="color: gold;">Bandogs are intelligent, loyal, protective, and at times highly aggressive; they have fantastic
				watch- and guard dog abilities, but they are illegal to own in many areas. Bandogs require
				moderate care (little grooming, moderate training, and a lot of exercise), and are pretty healthy
				overall.</p>

			<p>The Golden Retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the United States. The breed's friendly,
				tolerant attitude makes them great family pets, and their intelligence makes them highly capable working
				dogs. These dogs are fairly easy to train and get along in just about any home or family.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>The life expectancy of a Pug dog is between 12 and 15 years, though the majority of Pugs succumb closer
				to the low end of this. The average male will live 12.8 years and female Pugs live a bit longer, with
				average life span being 13.2 years. This said, a Pug can live well into his teens (15, 16 or even 17
				years).</p>
